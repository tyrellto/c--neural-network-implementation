# c--neural-network-implementation

The purpose of this is for my own curiosity, as I wish to understand the underworkings of famous frameworks, such as PyTorch.
I will eventually do CUDA implementations after I finish.
Aim to also create a visualization tool for a simple nn's hyperplane while training.

## TODO
1. Finish implementing ActivationFunctions
2. Work on implementing DenseLayers
